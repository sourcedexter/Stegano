This project helps hide messages within data. The text it uses to hide messages is the lorem ipsum.  
This also includes a feature to add an encryption key that can extract the data within the file in which the data is stored else the key can be used separately to extract the data. 

It also includes a visualisation after a data is hidden or extracted that shows where the message is hidden. 2 different colours are used alternatively to differentiate between words for visual purposes.
